when you start up the pi you have to nagivate to the folder containing the files for projecting.

first, you gotta open the terminal. press ctrl+alt+t

then to navigate to the folder that has the python scripts type

cd Desktop\photoreplicator\Projections

now to start the program you type

python3 generateShapeMotorTest.py SHAPE

the shape is determined by whatever shape you type to replace SHAPE
The available shapes are pretty confusing, but they are as follows:

rectangle - draws a rectangle
circle - draws a circle
pawn - draws a pawn
polygonTest - draws a rectangle -- this is the one I use whenever I draw a rectangle to the screen
cup - draws a thin walled cup
classTest - draws a thick walled cup
cone - draws a triangle to print a cone

so if you wanted to print a sphere type

python3 generateShapeMotorTest.py circle


once the program opens the controls are as follows:

MOTOR CONTROL
Q - turns on the motor to rotate the central motor
W - turns off the motor to rotate the central motor
E - (DONT USE) turns on the motors to rotate the lead screw motors 
R - turns off the motors to rotate the lead screw motors 

SHAPE CONTROL
Z           - increases the size of the object
X           - decreases the size of the object
LEFT ARROW  - moves the object to the left
RIGHT ARROW - moves the object to the right
UP ARROW    - moves the object up
DOWN ARROW  - moves the object down

STARTING EXPERIMENTS
ENTER   - starts the resin hardening
        - press once to begin the experiement. this changes the object color from red to purple
        - press again to end the experiment. this deactivates the resin and shows the time elapsed
        - youll have to turn off the motor rotation yourself

BACKDROP CONTROL (these are pretty outdated and no longer needed)
A - draws foreground object (on by default)
S - draws nothing but a purple background -- used for resin preheating
D - draws nothing but a yellow background -- used for completely disabling all foreground objects 

CHANGING SHAPE COLOR
1 - changes the foreground objects color to red
2 - changes the foreground objects color to purple
